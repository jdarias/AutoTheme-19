## How does it work?
You set a sunrise hour to set the clear theme and a sunset hour to activate the dark theme. Then the app sits on your system tray and waits for the specified time to change the theme.

If you work during nighttime you can set the app to activate the clear theme at night and the dark theme during the day.

You can also set the app to calculate the sunrise and sunset times according to your location. For this internet access is needed.

The tray icon will show a sun after sunrise hour until the sunset. At that time a moon icon will be displayed. 
## About location and privacy
The app uses the geocoder library to obtain your location from the Google Maps service. If you have concerns about Google knowing your location/IP please do not use this option.

This app does not "call home" nor collects data from you.
